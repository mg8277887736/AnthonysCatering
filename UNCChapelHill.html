	<p>UNC cheerleader Vic Huggins is credited with beginning the tradition of Ram mascots at UNC. In 1924, during a rough year for the football team, Huggins decided that UNC needed an animal mascot similar to N.C. State's wolf or Georgia's bulldog. The idea for using a ram came from the nickname for star Tar Heel fullback Jack Merritt, known as the "Battering Ram."<br>UNC's school colors come from two of the oldest student organizations on campus. The Dialectic and Philanthropic societies, literary and debate groups founded shortly after the University opened in 1795, each had its own distinctive color. The Dialectic Society's color was light blue and the Philanthropic Society's was white.<br>Students wore blue or white ribbons, depending on which society they belonged to, to dances and other school events. For many years, the ribbons were used on official certificates and diplomas.<br>When UNC began participating in intercollegiate sports in the late 1880s, choosing light blue and white were obvious choices for the school colors. The light blue color became so closely associated with the University that by the 1920s it was referred to as "Carolina blue."<br>The exact color of Carolina blue has often been debated. Early ribbons and publications show a very pale blue in contrast to the darker shade that was used for football and basketball uniforms in the late 20th century. In 2015, the University declared Pantone 542 as the official color of Carolina blue.</p>
